# Contributing

Interested in contributing to TensorFlow Scientific? We appreciate all kinds
of help and are working to make this guide as comprehensive as possible.
Please [let us know](https://github.com/mukeshmithrakumar/scientific/issues) if
you think of something we could do to help lower the barrier to
contributing.

## Pull Requests

We gladly welcome [pull requests](
https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

Before making any changes, we recommend opening an issue (if it
doesn't already exist) and discussing your proposed changes. This will
let us give you advice on the proposed changes. If the changes are
minor, then feel free to make them without discussion.

Want to contribute but not sure of what? Here are a few suggestions:
1. Add a new example or tutorial. Located in [`examples/`](examples),
  these are a great way to familiarize yourself and others with TF-Addons. See
  [the guidelines](examples/README.md) for more information on how to add
  examples.
2. Solve an [existing issue](https://github.com/mukeshmithrakumar/scientific/issues).
  These range from low-level software bugs to higher-level design problems.
  Check out the label [help wanted](https://github.com/mukeshmithrakumar/scientific/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). If you're a new contributor, the label [good first issue](https://github.com/mukeshmithrakumar/scientific/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) can be a good place to start.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require
